##Create a RoR application
    1. On the main page, display a list of customers (Customer model).
    2. In the list of clients, it should be possible to edit them and add anyone to the "black list".
    3. When a client is added to the blacklist, the record about him disappears from the main page and appears on a separate page "Blacklist".
    4. The application should be able to go to the "Black List" page - where you can see the clients that we have added to the black list.

###What else should be on the "black list" page:
    1. there must be a form that allows you to add a client to this list by phone
    2. there should be buttons in the list that allow you to exclude anyone from the "black list"

####Customer model parameters:
    1. name
    2. phone
    3. description
    4. present or not in the black list
